The Acolyte is an initiate in the [[Cult of the Dragon]], the lowest level minion in the cult. While unremarkable by themselves, a small group of acolytes can easily overpowered an unprepared group of adventurers or unorganized city guards. 

Acolytes are the most common affiliate of the cult to be found, and are usually identified by their pale-purple robes with the cult emblem embroidered on the back.

Acolytes are usually uniformed of the goings of the cult, and usually perform whatever duties are requested of them; cleaning, cooking, generic labor, delivery, shopping, or occasionally raiding. 

The [[The Raid on Greenest]] was the first major military move made by the cult in years, and prior to it, most people ignored these underlings as anything but errand runners and failed to report or do act against them in any sense.
