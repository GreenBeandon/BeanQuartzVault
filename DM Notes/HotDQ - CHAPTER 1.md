As characters approach Greenest, they see that a [[Blue Dragon (Adult)|Blue Dragon (Adult)]] and its [[Cult of the Dragon]] allies are attacking the town. The cultists seek to collect treasure they they hope to present to [[Tiamat]] upon her arrival in the world. The cult has assembled a powerful force for this raid by gathering [[Bandit]]s, [[Kobolds]], sellswords, and other [[Mercenary(CotD)]] types into a small army. A monk named [[Leosin Erlanthar]] was also in town. Through diligent research and interviews conducted during his travels between [[Berdusk]] and [[Candlekeep]], Leosin became convinced that the cult is engaged in a big operation, but he doesn't yet know what it is. Leosin uses the [[The Raid on Greenest]] as an opportunity to infiltrate the cult so that he can learn more about the cult's plans. He is discovered and captured, however, and needs the characters' help to escape from captivity. Characters can engage in several encounters while cultists and kobolds rampage through Greenest. 

The town is dimly lit by a half moon, burning buildings, and the bright illumination from the inside of the keep. 

Most of the fires in town come from haystacks and barns rather than from houses or shops. The thatched-roofed houses aren't as flammable as they first seem, though some will still be on fire

The stream can be easily crossed, movement speed is halved while walking through.

Mission 1: Seek The Keep

[[Governor Nighthill]] is the governor of Greenest and the surrounding regions. If players look for him, if the sky is clear, they may see him pacing atop the parapet of the keep. If the dragon is attacking, he'll be inside the keep. If they do not seek him out, he'll find them and welcome them to [[Greenest]]. The right side of [[Governor Nighthill]]'s face is bandaged and his right arm hangs in a sling. His blue tunic is stained with his own blood. If they inquire further, they may find that he was attacked during the beginning stages of the attack and has just failed to get them properly looked at. 

If the players ask for more information, they will be redirected to [[Castellan Escobert the Red]], the master of the keep. He is in charge of the keep's defense and will be the best source of information on the tunnel and sally port. He is a middle-aged dwarf with knotted, tangled, bring red hair. He face is adorned with mutton chops and a hint of a goatee. He is wearing chainmail with a sheathed short sword at his hip. A set of keys are jingling around as he moves about, attached to a leather necklace.
