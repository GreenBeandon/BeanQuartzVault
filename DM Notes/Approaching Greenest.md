As characters approach Greenest, they see that a [[Content To Be Added/Encounters/Blue Dragon|Blue Dragon]] and its [[Cult of the Dragon]] allies are attacking the town. The cultists seek to collect treasure they they hope to present to [[Tiamat]] upon her arrival in the world. The cult has assembled a powerful force for this raid by gathering [[Bandits]], [[Kobolds]], [[sellswords]], and other [[Mercenary(CotD)]] types into a small army. A monk named [[Leosin Erlanthar]] was also in town. Through diligent research and interviews conducted during his travels between [[Berdusk]] and [[Candlekeep]], Leosin became convinced that the cult is engaged in a big operation, but he doesn't yet know what it is. Leosin uses the [[The Raid on Greenest]] as an opportunity to infiltrate the cult so that he can learn more about the cult's plans. He is discovered and captured, however, and needs the characters' help to escape from captivity. Characters can engage in several encounters while cultists and kobolds rampage through Greenest.
