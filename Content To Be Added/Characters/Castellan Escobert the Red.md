# [[Castellan Escobert the Red]]
Escobert is a shield dwarf, master of the [[content/Locations/Greenest|Greenest]] Keep and is in charge of military matters during a defense. 

His title is a Castellan, which just means a governor or constable of a keep or castle. 

His nickname, "The Red" is due to his fiery-red hair. 

He is a middle-aged dwarf with knotted, tangled, bright red hair. He face is adorned with mutton chops and a hint of a goatee. During [[The Raid on Greenest]], he is wearing chainmail with a sheathed short sword at his hip. A set of keys are jingling around as he moves about, attached to a leather necklace.
