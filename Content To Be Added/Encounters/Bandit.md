Bandits are the general term used for any non-law abiding person who uses force to rob, maim, or kill people for any reason. Typically, bandits are poor combatants themselves and are fairly easy to overcome.

Bandits were seen assisting the [[Cult of the Dragon]] during [[The Raid on Greenest]] and were the primary force looting. 

They typically have no strong affiliation to any particular group and simple allies with wherever the money comes from.
