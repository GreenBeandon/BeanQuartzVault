For the past several days, you have been traveling a road that winds lazily across the rolling grasslands of the [[Greenfields]]. Sundown is approaching when you top a rise and see the town of [[content/Locations/Greenest|Greenest]] just a few short miles away. But instead of the pleasant, welcoming town you expected, you see columns of black smoke rising from burning buildings, running figures that are little more than dots at this distance, and a dark, winged shape wheeling low over the keep that rises above the center of the town. [[content/Locations/Greenest|Greenest]] is being attacked by a [[Blue Dragon (Adult)|Blue Dragon (Adult)]]!
