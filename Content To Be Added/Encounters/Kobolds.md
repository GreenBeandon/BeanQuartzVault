Kobolds are small, aggressive creatures that strongly resemble dragons. Kobolds are bipeds, with a long tapered tail, digitigrade legs with three scaled claws. Except in rare occasions, kobolds are toned, while a relatively strong upper and lower body, though compared to a common human, are distinctively weaker. 

Kobolds are known to wear simple sleeveless tunics and breeches, they typically carried a simple stone dagger and a sling on a belt at their waist. 

Kobolds are strongly associated with dragons, acting as their minions and oftentimes, as their slaves. Because of this, they are oftentimes associated with the [[Cult of the Dragon]] as well.
